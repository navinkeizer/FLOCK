This repository contains the code for evaluation of FLOCK, a scalable allocation solutions for decentralised services on blockchain. 

FLOCK uses Etheruem smart contracts, a trusted execution environment, stable matcing algorithms, and off-chain payment networks. 

For more information we refer to our paper in IEEE ICBC 2021: FLOCK: Fast, Lightweight, and Scalable Allocation for Decentralised Services on Blockchain.
